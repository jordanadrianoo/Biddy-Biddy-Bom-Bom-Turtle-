# Biddy-Biddy-Bom-Bom-Turtle-
I single handedly created a free roaming game where the user takes control of a turtle to complete simple tasks around various places on the map. There are 7 large areas that the turtle can explore. The map areas include a park, parking lot, forest, town, highway, funeral, quarry, and water treatment facility. This project took about 60 hours of development with C# and other unity tools.  

Warning: The source files could not be uploaded because of how large the game is. The PDF file can be downloaded and viewed. This PDF will go into grate detail about the game.
